What I Have Learned:
Most importantly, after doing some reading on how git works to guide my practice, I truely understand what is happening when I run commands like "git add xx", "git commit ...", "git reset ...", "git revert ...", etc. I consider it to be the solid base for all the operations to learn. 
Whatsmore, I get more skilled in terminal operations mentioned in the class. 
Lastly, although my inference accuracy is poor, I have successfully done my first try at calling a complex model, and learnt that a good understanding of the model's key idea would greatly facilitate my work.
